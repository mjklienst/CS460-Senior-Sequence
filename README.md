"HW6" consists of extracting data and searching through a huge already-made database called "World Wide Importers" and using LINQ queries to display certain information about an item after searching for it. Video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EapyZ7RHNAw&feature=youtu.be

"HW7" consists of using the GitHub API to extract data from my GitHub, such as personal info (name, email, and location), repository info (repo name, owner, and last updated), and used AJAX to display a list of all of the commits on a certain repo once clicked.
